    <p><b>Franklin provides volunteer cyber experts to water and wastewater utilities across the nation.</b> Franklin matches DEF CON technologists and cybersecurity experts with critical infrastructure operators looking for cybersecurity help. In particular, Franklin addresses an especially prime target for attackers: American water and wastewater systems. The program aims to help utilities nationwide that are most vulnerable and least protected from cyber threats. 
</p>
<p>
<ul> 
  <li> EPA: <a href = "https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-outlines-enforcement-measures-help-prevent-cybersecurity-attacks-and-protect">Over 70% </a> of surveyed utilities are not compliant with common cybersecurity standards despite increased risk of attacks, especially from <a href = "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a">China </a> </li>
<li> Just this past year, <a href = "https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/municipal-water-authority-of-aliquippa-hacked-iranian-backed-cyber-group/">Iranian- </a> and <a href = "https://apnews.com/article/texas-muleshoe-water-systems-cyberattacks-russia-5f388bf0d581fc8eb94b1190a7f29c3a"> Russian- </a>backed hacktivist groups gained access to small utilities in Pennsylvania and Texas</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Over the course of the project, Franklin researchers prepare volunteer resources, provide training, recruit potential volunteers, deploy assistance, and assess ongoing partnerships. This model builds upon a similar, successful CPI effort in 2020 that provided election officials with cybersecurity help. In order to offer the right support to our partners, Franklin developed a tiered model of cyber support that can be adjusted depending on the cyber maturity of the utility. </p>

  <ul>
<li> <b>Tier One: Cyber 101 </b>cybersecurity assistance, including changing default passwords, ensuring safe password storage, multi-factor authentication, and so forth</li>
<li> <b>Tier Two: Enhanced Cyber Hygiene </b> cybersecurity measures, including assisting with inventory and control of assets, conducting secure account management, and developing malware defenses </li>
<li> <b>Tier Three: Continuous Monitoring and Remediation </b> of network post enterprise assessment.</li>
</ul>
</p>

LATEST â€” Recently, the program received coverage in local and regional news outlets for its work in <a href = "https://www.wcax.com/video/2025/02/18/waterbury-joins-cybersecurity-initiative-protect-utilities-2/">Waterbury, VT </a> and <a href = "https://www.newsbug.info/rensselaer_republican/news/city-of-rensselaer-kicks-off-cybersecurity-effort-to-protect-its-water-systems/article_90452178-f414-11ef-ac4e-b7b7a606091f.html"> Rensselaer, IN </a>. 

Franklin is currently providing assistance to water utilities across four states: <b> Utah, Vermont, Indiana and Oregon</b>. Going forward, Franklin researchers will continue to assess ongoing efforts at utilities, distill analysis and lessons learned, and identify new partnerships across the nation.
