He was instrumental in the effort to gain passage in the European Parliament of the largest data-sharing agreement in history between the United States and the European Union. In addition, Mr. Braun designed and implemented a program to modernize the DHS cybersecurity workforce and supported efforts to expand US-CERT, the NCCIC, and CDM.

Most recently, he partnered with DEF CON to launch “Franklin,” a program to memorialize the most innovative and impactful findings from DEF CON in the annual “Hackers’ Almanack.”  “Franklin” also recruits cyber volunteers to support underresourced critical infrastructure.

      Mr. Braun began his career in politics and journalism.  He has worked on five presidential campaigns and, separately, as a journalist for newspapers in Illinois and Taiwan.
