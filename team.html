    <h4> Jake Braun</h4> 
    <p>
      Jake Braun is the Executive Director of the Cyber Policy Initiative at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and Co-Founder of Cambridge Global Advisors, a national security consulting firm. He most recently served in The White House as acting Principal Deputy National Cyber Director. Prior to that role, Mr. Braun was appointed by The President as Senior Counselor to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Braun is the author of Democracy in Danger: How Hackers and Activists Exposed Fatal Flaws in the Election System (Rowman & Littlefield, 2019).
    </p>

    <p>
    In 2009 Mr. Braun was appointed by President Obama as White House Liaison to the Department of Homeland Security. He was instrumental in the effort to gain passage in the European Parliament of the largest data-sharing agreement in history between the United States and the European Union. In addition, Mr. Braun designed and implemented a program to modernize the DHS cybersecurity workforce and supported efforts to expand US-CERT, the NCCIC, and CDM. Before his tenure as White House Liaison, Mr. Braun served on the Presidential Transition Team for the Obama Administration as Deputy Director for the National Security Agencies Review. </p>

    <p> In addition to his role at the University of Chicago, Mr. Braun co-founded the DEF CON Voting Machine Hacking Village. In that capacity he co-authored two award-winning reports on the cyber security of our election infrastructure: the DEF CON 25 and 26 Voting Village Reports.  Most recently, he partnered with DEF CON to launch “Franklin,” a program to memorialize the most innovative and impactful findings from DEF CON in the annual “Hackers’ Almanack.”  “Franklin” also recruits cyber volunteers to support underresourced critical infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Braun began his career in politics and journalism.  He has worked on five presidential campaigns and, separately, as a journalist for newspapers in Illinois and Taiwan. He holds an MA in International Relations from Troy State University, an MA in Education from National-Louis University, Chicago, and a BA in Philosophy from Loyola University of Chicago.
